## Human languages                         
My mother tongue is french.
I read and write english fluently. Top B2 level.

## Software preferences
### Tools                                  
I try to use small tools, that follow the KISS principles.  
I run `OpenBSD` on my personal desktop, `Arch Linux` on my professional laptop and my server runs on FreeBSD ; diversity, you know this word?  
I use `i3` as a windows manager... it's stupid simple and do the job, the further the mouse from my hand is the better I am.  
I felt in love with the `zsh` shell with `tmux` to keep my shells organized.  
I use `nvim` to edit anything that contains characters.  
I use `mutt` for my mails and `irssi` for chatting on `IRC`.

### Languages                              
`Go` and `C` are my preferred languages. With that you can conquere the world.

> **_NOTE:_** Currently, learning Zig.
