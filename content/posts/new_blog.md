Here is my new blog with less features, no javascript, just pure html + css.

## Why no javascript?
The current hype is to put a lot of features in javascript, to make things shiny (known as bloated web).
**Who cares?**  
Internet is here to find relevant information to improve yourself, to learn... do you have shiny 
things in a book? You have words, just words.


Sometimes it's good to remember the pioneers, here is one of my favorite quote:

> "Everything was small... and my heart sinks for Linux when I see the size of it. [...] 
> The manual page, which really used to be a manual page, is now a small volume, with a thousand 
> options... We used to sit around in the Unix Room saying, 'What can we throw out?
> Why is there this option?' It's often because there is some deficiency in the basic design â€”
> you didn't really hit the right design point. Instead of adding an option,
> think about what was forcing you to add that option."

## A place in the world
Basically, I just want to share the things I learn along my journey but also what makes me angry in the 
IT industry (I think this section will be called `punching ball time`).  


Thx for reading. And learn, always!
